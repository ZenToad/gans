==========================================
Games are not software
==========================================

IDEA: What if we make a tiny game engine/runner 
BUT...
it's really limited in what is can do.

game_engine_editor.exe
game_engine_runner.exe

Most features will be the simplest possible.
No need for shaders, resource manager, etc...

If we design each subsystem to be self-contained and
have very few features it will be easier to get something going.

For example: Animation
Do we need to support spine?  No.

Sprites?  What if there are no sprite, only shapes and single colors.

This is a tutorial for making a game in game maker.
Could we do the same thing with custom code?

What is next...

Create object player

    How does that work?

    Normally I would write code to do it.
    obj_t player = new obj_t();

    player.sprite = ship;


    But how would there be a bunch of files compressed
    into the game file that does this?

    could we put everything into a json file?

    object = {
        name = "player",
        sprite = "ship"
    }

That's actually pretty easy.

We can create a game obj that is just the singleton thingy

    object = {
        name = "game",
        ...
    }

But let's say we want to script all this stuff too.
We can do that with lua, right?

lua 5.4 has been out for a year now, so it's still under development...

We can attach the script to each obj and let that do the game specific stuff.
We could even pre-compile all the scripts to include in the game.

Hmm, this is getting interesting...

We can attch scripts to objects.

    object.script = "player_script",

The lua script for the object will call stuff like

-- player_script.lua
function init()

end

function update()

end

etc...


Another part of this is that the level, or Room,
is an asset.  We can spawn instances of objects in the room
and add triggers and stuff.

It should be pretty easy to make all this stuff, but I
bet the devil is in the details for sure...
